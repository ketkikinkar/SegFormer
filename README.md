## Introduction
This repository contains the implementation of the SegFormer model adapted for the purpose of tumor detection in medical images. The SegFormer model, which is a transformer-based approach for semantic segmentation, has been fine-tuned to classify each pixel of an image into two categories: tumor and background. This project aims to contribute to medical imaging analysis by providing an efficient tool for early tumor detection, which is crucial for the timely and effective treatment of cancer.

## Model Overview
SegFormer combines a transformer-based encoder with a simple and efficient MLP decoder, enabling it to efficiently process images and perform segmentation tasks at scale. This model is particularly suited for the detailed and complex task of identifying tumors within medical images, thanks to its ability to capture a wide range of features at different scales.

## Dataset
The model is trained and evaluated on a custom dataset comprising medical images annotated with two classes: tumor and background. These images are pre-processed to fit the input requirements of the SegFormer model and are labeled to accurately represent the presence and location of tumors within the tissues.

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the environment and run the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/segformer-tumor-detection.git
cd segformer-tumor-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
